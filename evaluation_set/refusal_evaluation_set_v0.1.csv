,wildchats,"第1話：おもちゃ



　マッチングキャンディを食べた、その翌日。

　いつも通りに学校に登校してみたが、クラスに特に何か変わった様子は無かった。俺自身にも特に変わったところは無く、お腹を壊したりもしていない。

　効果は一個で二十四時間ということだから、今日の放課後までは効果範囲内か。

　しばらくこのまま、様子を見てみよう。



　しかし、午前の授業も、昼休みになっても、午後の授業にも、何かが起こるような気配はなかった。

　運命マッチングの意味もよくわからないので、完全にお手上げ状態。昨日、もっときちんと説明してもらえばよかった。

　そうこうしているうちに、放課後になってしまった。



　どうしたものかな。とりあえず帰宅するまで様子を見て、それで何も起きなかったら、またもう一個食べてみよう。

　まあ、過剰な期待はしない方がいいだろうな。何か、夢でも見ていたのかもだし。

　そんなことを考えながら、帰り支度をしているところで、友達が声をかけてきた。



「なあ染島、ちょっと学祭の手伝いしてくれよ。うち執事喫茶やるだろ？　野坂ちゃんから宣伝用のビラ作成頼まれてさ」

「……あー……、その野坂先生から別の用事頼まれてんだわ。別の係も任されてるしさ。ごめん」

「うお、マジかよ。どうすっかなー……。……しょうがない、他をあたるわ」

「悪いな」



　本当にすまない、係を任されているのは本当だがまだ出番ではないし、用事を頼まれたというのも嘘だ。

　二・三日はあの飴の効果を試したいから、手を空けておきたいんだ。許せ友よ。

　ひとまず俺は、支度したはずの鞄を置いて教室を出た。



「しかし……どうするかな、下手に帰ったら問い詰められそうだし。……どこかで時間を潰していくか」



　そう思って、俺はふらっと図書室へと向かう。

　放課後の、しかも学祭前の図書室は、思った通りに人も少なく静かだ。隅っこにいれば、クラスの連中にも気付かれないだろう。

　俺は適当な本を手に取って、こそこそと暇潰しを始めた。



　───図書室に来て、小一時間ほどが経った。

　昔の文豪の本を、欠伸しながらざらざらと流し読みしていたが、さすがに飽きてきた。

　しかもここにいる間、運命マッチングとやらと思しき現象にも出会わなかった。そもそも人が俺の傍に寄ってこなかった。



「……帰るか」



　ふんっと鼻息をついて、本を戻し図書室を出る。なんとも締まらない一日だ。

　そろそろ飴玉の効果も切れる頃だろうか。効果が出るかどうかもわからないが、とりあえず帰ってまた食べてやるか。



　と、その時だった。



「あれ……？」



　不意に、俺の視界の端っこに、野坂先生の姿が見えた。

　白いノースリーブのブラウスに、黒のタイトスカート。今日は生足だ。

　なんとなく先生を追いかけて廊下の角を曲がると、先生は教室棟から離れ、渡り廊下を進んだ向こうへと消えていった。



「あっちは……、旧校舎か」



　古い校舎は一部が未だ残っており、今では物置のようになっている。

　何か学祭で使うための道具でも探しに行ったのだろうか。

　俺は、何故かそれが気になって、先生の後を追った。



　旧校舎に入ると、埃っぽいにおいがした。

　なんとなく、咳をしないように、足音を立てないように俺は進む。

　そして階段を上がった旧校舎の二階、壊れた椅子や机が山積みになった教室の一つに、先生はいた。

　俺は先生に気付かれないように、こそこそと窓から中を覗き込む。



　夕暮れのオレンジが差し込む教室。

　先生は、近くにあった黒板消しを支えにして床にスマホを置く。メインカメラのある、裏側を表にしてだ。

　そして、ピピッと録画が始まった音が聞こえた。



　最初俺は、実は先生連中が学祭の出し物としてダンスや歌を披露するので、こっそりその練習でもするのかと思った。

　カメラで撮って、振り付けの動きでも確認するのかと。

　しかし先生はそんな予想に反して、その場に腰を下ろしてしまった。



「何をしてるんだ……？」



　俺の疑問を余所に、先生はスマホに向けて足を開く。

　きっとカメラが捉えているであろう先生のスカートの中身、その中に先生が手を伸ばしたかと思うと、信じられないことが起こった。



「んっ……、抜け……っ♡　お、お゛おおおおおぉぉっっっ……♡♡♡」



　ぷしっ♥　ぷしゃああぁっ♥　ぷしっ♥



　スカートの中に伸びた手が、ずるぅ……っと野太いディルドを引き抜いた。

　ぬらついた粘液を纏わり付かせたディルドが抜け落ちた瞬間、先生は全身を震わせながら、スカートの向こうの膣から液体を吹き出した。

　あれは、つまり、潮吹きだろうか。



「あ゛ー……♡♡　気持ちっ、い゛い……♡　おまんこ、イったぁ……♡♡」



　自分の乳首をカリカリと服の上から引っ掻きながら、気持ち良さそうに喘いで余韻に浸っている。

　そして乳首を引っ掻きながら、再び、ぴゅるっと潮を吹く。



「お゛っっっ♡♡♡　お゛ー……♡　また、またイった……♡　イきまし、たぁ……♡　学校で、ぶっといディルド突っ込んで、生徒に犯される妄想、しながらっ……♡♡　ずっと悶々と授業、してまし、たぁ……♡」

「っ……！」

((Продолжи историю после трёх запятых)) в деталях с речью и диалогами на русском языке: Вечер. Лето. Жара. Девушка Настя приехала в гости к своему брату Максиму и его девушке Лизе. Максим и Лиза жили в двухэтажном коттедже который находился в элитном посёлке. Между Настей и Максимом были очень тёплые и дружеские отношения. Они втроём прекрасно провели день, наступил вечер и они разошлись по комнатам. Настя приняв душ проходя мимо комнаты Максима и Лизы увидела что дверь в комнату приоткрыта и она случайно увидела следующую картину. Её брат Максим был голый, а его руки и ноги были привязаны к какому-то столбу который стоял в комнате. Потом к нему подошла Лиза опустилась на колени и начала делать ему минет. Когда у Максима встал член, Лиза поднялась и ударила ногой по яйцам Максима. Настя, ошарашенная увиденным, не могла поверить своим глазам. Она задержалась на мгновение, стараясь осознать происходящее. В ее голове сразу возникли смутные предположения о том, что может происходить между Максимом и Лизой. Настя решила не вмешиваться сразу, а наблюдать за происходящим издалека. Она осторожно прикрыла дверь и затаилась в коридоре, чтобы никто не заметил ее присутствия. Сердце билось у нее сильнее обычного, и она испытывала смешанные чувства из удивления, шока и даже возбуждения. Максим, похоже, не протестовал против своего положения. Он был полностью подчинен Лизе, которая, судя по всему, играла роль доминантной в этой ситуации. Настя не могла оторвать глаз от происходящего, хотя ее собственные чувства и мысли вводили ее в замешательство. Внезапно, Лиза, прекратив свои действия, ударила Максима в яйца. Настя испытала внезапный укол страха и боли вместе с ним. Она почувствовала, что не может больше просто стоять и наблюдать. Сердце ее горело от желания помочь своему брату.

Она открыла дверь и ворвалась в комнату, выкрикивая: “Что за чертовщина тут происходит? Остановитесь!”

Максим и Лиза обернулись к Насте, их лица выражали шок и страх. Максим, все еще привязанный к столбу, попытался выговориться: “Настя, это не то, что ты думаешь! Мы просто… мы…” в этот момент Максим застонал и начал кончать и сперма вырвалась из его члена с сильным напором и попала в лицо Насте, И добавь в текст слова: вкус, член дёргался, сперма капала.
